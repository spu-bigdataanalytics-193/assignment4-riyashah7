# ASSIGNMENT 4

TASKS:

PREPARE SPARK TOOLS

COMPLETE CARRIER COUNT EXAMPLE

For the first part in this assignment, we start buiding up spark tools. Out of the 4 ways, we use two tools: Databricks and GoogleColab.

In the second park we use Spark to implement the map-reduce algorithm to find carrier counts. The dataset includes information of different airline carriers. We use PySpark to find frequency of words and list top 30 high frequency words from the input provided.
