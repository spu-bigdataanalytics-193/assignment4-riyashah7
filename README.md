# ASSIGNMENT 4

TASKS:

PREPARE SPARK TOOLS

COMPLETE CARRIER COUNT EXAMPLE

For the first part in this assignment, we start wiht buiding up spark tools. Out of the 4 ways, we use two tools: Databricks and GoogleColab.

In the second park we use Spark to implement the map-reduce algorithm to find carrier counts. The dataset includes information of different airline carriers.
